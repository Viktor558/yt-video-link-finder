# yt-video-link-finder
Search for a youtube video and this script will give you the original title of the video and it's link.

Current version: 1.7

========================================================================================================================

The script of this project is written in Python (python 3.5.2).
In order to run them you have to install python (which you probably know just saying...)

What's new in 1.7?
- A save-links-to-file feature which allow the title and link of the video that you have been searching for to save in a file named "savedLinks.txt" in the same directory as the script. 

What's new in 1.4?
- An Auto-play feature which allows the video that you have been searching for to opens up in (your default) browser.
- A run.bat file which lets you easily run the script. Well, not really, but it looks cooler like this :P

================================ RULES ================================
1. Don't delete the 'options.txt' file or some features won't work
