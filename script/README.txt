The script of this project is written in Python (python 3.5.2).
In order to run them you have to install python (which you probably know just saying...)

What's new in 1.4?
- An Auto-play feature where the video that you have been searching for opens up in (your default) browser.
- A run.bat file which lets you easily run the script. Well, not really, but it looks cooler like this :P

================================ RULES ================================
1. Don't delete the 'options.txt' file or some features won't work
